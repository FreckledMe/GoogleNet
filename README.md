# GoogleNet
 
Google Net (or Inception V1) was proposed by research at Google (with the collaboration of various universities) in 2014 in the research paper titled “Going Deeper with Convolutions”. This architecture was the winner at the ILSVRC 2014 image classification challenge. It has provided a significant decrease in error rate as compared to previous winners AlexNet (Winner of ILSVRC 2012) and ZF-Net (Winner of ILSVRC 2013) and significantly less error rate than VGG (2014 runner up). This architecture uses techniques such as 1×1 convolutions in the middle of the architecture and global average pooling.
